# HAProxy - JWT

Demonstrates verifying OAuth 2 JSON web tokens in HAProxy using Lua code. See the [HAProxy OAuth library here](https://github.com/haproxytech/haproxy-lua-oauth).

Set up:

1. Sign up for a free account at https://auth0.com/ and create a new API.
1. Under the *Scopes* tab for the API, add a "read:hamsters" scope and a "write:hamsters" scope.
1. Add a new "Machine to Machine Application" on the Auth0 site and select the API you created. Grant the "read" and "write" scopes.
1. Replace the pem/pubkey.pem with the public key from your application's Settings tab: **Applications > My App > Settings > Show Advanced Settings > Certificates > Download Certificate**. (Be sure to convert it first using `openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in ./mycert.pem > pubkey.pem`)
1. Edit haproxy/haproxy.cfg, replacing the Auth0 URL with your own, such as https://myaccount.auth0.com/
1. Create the environment with Vagrant:
    ```
    vagrant up
    ```
1. Get a JSON web token (JWT) from your authentication server by following the *Quick Start* on the Auth0 website, under the Applications tab, for your Machine to Machine application.
1. Make requests to https://192.168.50.20/api/hamsters and attach the JWT in the Authorization header. You should get a successful response.

## Troubleshooting

Check that the haproxy service is running:

```
sudo systemctl status haproxy
```

You can check if the haproxy.cfg file is valid with this command:

```
sudo haproxy -c -f /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
```

Debug the incoming requests with:

```
sudo haproxy -d -f /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
```

SSH into the VM with `vagrant ssh` and and make sure the node.js website is running:

```
cd /vagrant/web
docker-compose build
sudo docker-compose up -d
```
